 I am experiencing overfitting during training. The cnn will become very accurate with the data it has the answers to
 but only 70 percent accurate with data it validates itself on.
**********************************************************************************************************************

10/21/2019 - testing to see if raising the validation split to 0.2 will raise the val_accuracy above 0.7
    val_accuracy dipped at the 15th epoch - 0.6369
    val_accuracy totalled 0.6844 at the end of 50 epoch run
    FAILED

10/22/2019 - Testing to see if killing more neurons will improve accuracy above 0.7
    val_accuracy totalled 0.67840 at the end of 50 epoch run
    FAILED

10/29/2019 - There is no difference in the max validation accuracy that the cnn will reach when the 512 neuron and 1024 neuron models
are compared. Additionally there is no rise above 0.7 val_accuracy when creating and only creating a second Dense layer of 512 or 1024
neurons.
